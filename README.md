# PATIENTmANAGEMENT-MVC
there is model the state of the patient and the hotel, and the way the state changes. Patient-Number is auto generated. The model is independent of the view and the controller.   None of the code in the model class makes any assumptions about the way that the model is displayed.  It is easy to add alternative views of the same model.     Although a view does depend on the model the views are independent of each other.  Then want to add, display, and exit.
